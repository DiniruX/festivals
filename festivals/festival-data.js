    desc: "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marking the beginning of Sri Lanka&rsquo;s Buddhist Calendar, the Duruthu Perahera is one of the most culturally glorious processions celebrated by devotees annually during the month of&nbsp;January&nbsp;(Duruthu). The main festivities are organized at the historic Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya (Temple) annually during the pre-full moon poya day in&nbsp;January&nbsp;to mark the first visit of Lord Buddha to Sri Lanka. Dating back to the year 1927, this grand assemblage is witnessed and celebrated by devotees who arrive in Kelaniya from all parts of the country not failing to attract tourists who are left in awe with the festivities carried out during this auspicious time period. The traditions and culture of the grand heritage of Sri Lanka is depicted throughout the procession which is considered the highlight of many rituals and ceremonies preceding the event. The entire festival consists of three stages while it commences with a series of religious sermons held each night which leads up to the festivities.That is followed by a week of Pirith Ceremonies and finally ending all celebratory proceedings with the Perahera which is held during three consecutive nights.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The &ldquo;Udamaluwa Perahera&rdquo; which is the first day procession is held in the upper terrace area of the Kelaniya Temple. Here the Dathu Perahera is conducted in a small scale with only a few elephants, whip crackers, fire dancers, flag bearers, dancers and drummers. The &ldquo;Pahatha Maluwa Perahera&rdquo; which is the second day procession is more colourful and elaborate than the first with the Dathu Perahera leading and the three Devala Peraheras trailing behind. The &ldquo;Randholi Perahera&rdquo; which is the third and final procession of the Duruthu Maha Perahera is a magnificent spectacle of colour, tradition, grandeur and religious fervour. Many of the devotees who gather in the temple premises join in the celebrations by chanting on the roadsides.</p>",

<p class="pf0"><span class="cf0">Vesak also known as Buddha Jayanti, Buddha Purnima, </span><span class="cf0">Visak</span> <span class="cf0">Bochea</span><span class="cf0"> and Buddha Day, is a holiday traditionally observed by Buddhists in South Asia and Southeast Asia, as well as in Tibet and Mongolia. It is among the most important Buddhist festivals. The festival commemorates the birth, enlightenment (Pali - </span><span class="cf0">Nibb</span><span class="cf1">āna</span><span class="cf1">, Sanskrit - </span><span class="cf1">Nirvā</span><span class="cf0">ṇa</span><span class="cf0">), and death (</span><span class="cf0">Parinirv</span><span class="cf1">āna</span><span class="cf1">) of Gautama Buddha in Theravada, Tibetan Buddhism, and </span><span class="cf1">Navayana</span><span class="cf1">. </span></p>
<p class="pf0"><span class="cf1">The name Vesak is derived from the Pali term </span><span class="cf1">vesākha</span><span class="cf1"> or Sanskrit </span><span class="cf1">vaiśākha</span><span class="cf1"> for the lunar month of Vaisakha, which is considered the month of Buddha's birth. In Mahayana Buddhist traditions, the holiday is known by its Sanskrit name (</span><span class="cf1">Vaiśākha</span><span class="cf1">) and derived variants of it.</span></p>
<p class="pf0"><span class="cf1">In the East Asian tradition, a celebration of Buddha's Birthday typically occurs around the traditional timing of Vesak, while the Buddha's awakening and death are celebrated as separate holidays that occur at other times in the calendar as Bodhi Day and </span><span class="cf1">Nibbāna</span><span class="cf1"> Day. In the South Asian tradition, where Vesak is celebrated on the full moon day of the Vaisakha month, the Vesak day marks the birth, enlightenment, and the ultimate death of the Buddha. </span></p>

<p>The <strong>Waas Season</strong> (also known as <em>Vassana</em> or <em>Vassa</em>) is a sacred three-month retreat observed annually by <strong>Buddhist monks</strong> during the rainy season. While it begins on the <strong>Esala Poya Day</strong> in <strong>July</strong>, <strong>September</strong> marks the <strong>culminating period</strong> of this spiritual observance. During this time, monks <strong>reside in one monastery</strong>, refraining from travel, and engage deeply in <strong>meditation, dhamma discussions</strong>, and <strong>community service</strong>.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, lay devotees also participate by offering <strong>alms (dana)</strong>, listening to <strong>sermons</strong>, and supporting the monks in their practices. The Waas period concludes with the <strong>Katina Ceremony</strong>, which is often held in <strong>October or early November</strong>, where the faithful offer <strong>new robes</strong> and requisites to the monks.</p>
